# AngularJS Template

The AngularJS Template is an opiniated template for developing large AngularJS 1.x web applications with Typescript. Among other things, it features:

* A fully configurable Gulp system that takes care of debug builds, production builds, code vetting, Angular-specific optimizations and basic deployments.
* A project structure designed for large codebases, built on top of a powerful module system.
* A set of Typescript Bower packages that provide useful capabilities such as base classes, common services and components, and widget abstractions.

The template is designed to be used as a starting point for your own AngularJS application.
